We design new algorithms to solve bioinformatics problems. Our work is focused around the Next Generation Sequencing Experience Platform ([NGSEP](https://sourceforge.net/p/ngsep/wiki/Home/)).

To check out our current work you can check our dedicated [github repositories](https://github.com/orgs/FLAGlab/teams/bioinformatics)
