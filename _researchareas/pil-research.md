The PiL pilar of the FLAGlab on the design and implementation of new programming languages and paradigms for the development of new generation software systems.

Our work focuses in the developping Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), type systems, and the
verification and validation of software sytems at the programming language level.

Our main application domain is adaptive systems for smart cities, context-oriented porgramming (COP) languages, and other engineering domains.
