The PiL pilar of the FLAGlab on the design and implementation of new programming languages and paradigms for the development of new generation software systems.

Our work focuses in the development of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), type systems, and the
verification and validation of software sytems at the programming language level. We focuse in programming alnguages for smart, interconnected, and next generation environments.

### Smart Environments

Our main application domain is on smart adaptive systems, which include smart cities, smart transport, IoT and cyberphysical environments. In this domain area we work on Context-oriented Porgramming (COP) languages as a driver to foster smarter systems that can react to the conditions of their surrounding environment and offer the most appropriate behavior to users.

### Interconnected Environments

We are currently developing new programming models for distributed systems tailored to manage uncertainty from the environment.
