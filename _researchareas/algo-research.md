The algorithms pilar of the FLAG lab is centered on the analysis, design, and development of exact and approximated algorithms and data structures.

One of our lines of work is dedicated in efficient algorithm design for real world problems. We actively participate in programming competitions (international: [ICPC](https://icpc.global), local: [CCPL](https://www.programmingleague.org) and [RPC](http://redprogramacioncompetitiva.com))

To check out our current work you can check our dedicated [github repositories](https://github.com/orgs/FLAGlab/teams/algorithms)
