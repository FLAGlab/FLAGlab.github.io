The Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning research pillar at the FLAG lab, focuses in the development of cutting edge approaches for the advancement of this important domain. 
Furthermore, we are interested in the intersection of AI and Machine Learning with other disciplines in the domain of computer science such as recomender systems, smart cities, Internet of Things, to mention a few.

We apply the proposed approaches in a variety of domains including technology enchanced learning, software verification, and programming languages.
