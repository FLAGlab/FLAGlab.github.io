### Context

Polling companies are tasked with collecting information for different purposes, such as political polls, sensus surveys, or market sureveys.
Normally, these polls are executed manually, where an interviwer is task with asking a set of questions to an assigned section of the population.

### Project proposal

In this project we will explore reinforecement learning techniques to automate the polling process such that we can optimize the polls with respect to the charcteristcs of the person in charge of the poll and the person being question, so that the success and effectiveness of the poll is maximized.

### Implementation plan

This thesis will apply and evaluate classic reinforcement learning algorithms, with the extension to multi-agent systems
