### Context
Exam scheduling is a classic problem of multiobjective optimization. This is also a known NP-complte problem (whenever more than 3 timeslots are to be scheduled). Nonetheless, term after term students take exams in thousands of universities around the world. However, the problems is far removed from an optimal solution 

### Project proposal
This thesis will explore Software Module theory (SMT) approximations to the exam scheduling problem 


### Implementation plan
- Exploration of Oscar [1]
- Integration of different CP techniques for Oscar
- Integration of different restrictions to the problem
- Evaluation of the techniques using exam scheduling for Uniandes
