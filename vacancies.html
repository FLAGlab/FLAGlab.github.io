    <h2>Ph.D. Teaching Assistant Position</h2>
</p>
<br>

<p>
   <b>Description:</b>
    We are looking for a motivated Ph.D student to join the FLAG research lab at Universidad de los Andes, as a teaching Ph.D. assistant working with Prof Nicol√°s Cardozo. 
    FLAGlab is an interdisciplinary research group focusing on the fundamental aspects of programming languages, algorithms, and artificial intelligence in computer science. Prospective candidates are expected to contribute to the group's research efforts. The current position is open to work on the topic of program analysis, as described next. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Research topic:</b>
    The candidate will work on the general area of program analysis. In particular, we are working on improving the development of multi-language codebases, as for example in the domain of mobile apps. The objective of this project is to propose new cross-language program analysis techniques to tackle the difficulties in maintaining and evolving systems' functionality across code-bases in different programming languages.
    The goal of the project is to research the simultaneous reasoning in different programming language semantics.
    To attain this goal the candidate will develop analysis tools and methods to detect, track, and recommend concrete code snippets across different programming languages, effectively enabling their co-evolution.
    <br>
    The work will continue our research direction on cross-language code clone detection, and will work on mobile phone platforms as application domain, but other domains can be explored (e.g., scientific libraries, multi-language parsers/compilers).
    <br>
    The position is offered for 4 years, as a teaching research assistant (knowledge of the fundamentals of computer science is required). This position covers the program's full tuition and stipend. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Requirements:</b>
    Applicants should hold a Master degree in computer science or a related discipline (demonstrating a strong computing component/knowledge), demonstrating to be at the top of your class, and proof of english proficiency and scientific writing. 
    You are required to follow the vetting process of the admission requirements at Universidad de los Andes.

    <h2>Ph.D. Research Assistant Position</h2>
</p>
<br>

<p>
   <b>Description:</b>
   We are looking for motivated people to join us as Ph.D. students. The candidates will join the lively research environment of The Software Design Lab and FLAG lab for  a truly interdisciplinary research experience in both software engineering and artificial intelligence/machine learning.  
   The current positions are open to work on the topic of e-learning in the context of an industrial Ph.D., in which the candidate will be required to participate actively in the activities of the industrial partner. 
   <br><br>
    <b>Research topic:</b>
    The candidates will work on the general area of automated learning trajectories with aid of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.  
    The research project for the candidates will focus in the automation of learning trajectories using multiple online resources to maximize the learner's experience and subject comprehension. The main objective of the project is divided into three different axes  reconciling and integrating different areas of artificial intelligence:   
    <ul>
        <il> Knowledge representation: will be used to describe (e.g., using ontologies) and structure (e.g., through knowledge graphs) different learning resources for a given topic or subject of study.  </il>
 
        <il> Natural language processing: will be used for topic classification an to organize learning resources in different coherent trajectories based on difficulty, prerequisites, or popularity in usage by successful learners.  </il>
 
        <il> Machine learning: will be used to categorize and optimize trajectories based on information gathered from multiple other learners. </il>
 
        <il> Recommender systems: will be used to suggest appropriate trajectories for  learners, taking into account their past performance and learning pace. </il>
 
        <il> Software engineering: will be used to deploy the models on a real software solution that will serve daily thousands of users. </il>
    </ul>    
    The work will be made concrete with the implementation of a learning platform to host learning resources, trajectories, and user information, together with a mobile application to maximize learners' accessibility and engagement with the material.  
 
The positions are offered for 4 years, as a research assistant part of the project. The position will cover tuition and stippend.
