### Context
Reactive programming follows the idea of dataflow languages, in which operations are processed in reaction to changes to input information, rather than pulled by the user using an event system.

Reacive programming languages have proven key in the last decade to process large quantities of events (continuously generated by big data systems) and to realize smart systems (fostered by the Internet of Things). However, reactive practices have not yet been integrated with main stream languages, except for its integration by means of external frameworks. 

### Project proposal
The purpose of this project is to provide a native implementation of reactive programming in a main stream language, such as Kotlin.
This project looks to implementa a reactive language on top of Kotlin, in order to process events comming from a continuous channel (e.g., information gathered from a camera). 
The langauge will be used to process events from electronic signals.


### Implementation plan
Reactive extension of Kotlin based on REScala
