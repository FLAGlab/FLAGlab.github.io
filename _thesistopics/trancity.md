### Context

Transport systems are examples of large multi-agent systems exhibiting complex interactions and emergent behavior.

### Project proposal

In this project you will implement a large functinal transport management system, taking into account the behavior of users and buses, and allowing for the detection of alerts to abnormal behavior in the system.

### Implementation plan

The implementation of the project consists in fully building the simulator for TranCity [1] starting from an existing codebase implemented in JavaScript.
